I'm a PhD candidate and research associate at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/), where I work in [Michael Hedderich's](https://www.michael-hedderich.de) [research group](https://michael-hedderich.de/group/), that is affiliated with [Barbara Plank's](https://bplank.github.io) [MaiNLP](https://mainlp.github.io) lab and the [Center for Information and Language Processing (CIS)](https://www.cis.lmu.de). I am also affiliated with the [Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML)](https://www.mcml.ai).

If you're interested in collaborating or just connecting, drop me an email or send me a request on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-eichin/). For more informal things, you can find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/florianeichin.bsky.social).

Research interests
----
Currently, and without any order of priority, my research interests include
- Language representations and measures of similarity between them
- Explainable AI and interpretability 
- Model component and data attribution methods
- How learning dynamics interact with these areas

Besides, I like working with [data from social networks](https://florian-eichin.com/talks/2024-03-14-aas) and [topic modeling](https://florian-eichin.com/publication/2024-10-28-semantic-components).
