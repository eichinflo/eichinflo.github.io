Another page of another guy who's trying to make another "awesome" idea work. You've probably reached this page because I told you about it. So far, there is not much to see here so let me at least introduce myself:

This is Florian Eichin, currently in the process of finishing my [Master's in Mathematics in Data Science](https://www.ma.tum.de/en/studies-information/study-programs-mathematics/master-mathematics-in-data-science.html) at [Technical University of Munich](https://www.cit.tum.de/en/cit/home/). Talk to me about your interests and I'll probably get excited, too. Try Natural Language Processing, social computing or chinese tea culture to keep me talking for hours. 

On [Twitter](https://twitter.com/florian_eichin) you can see me commenting on social and political issues (and be part of my massive follower base). For professional inquiries, connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-eichin/).


Next Steps
=====

Besides finishing this website I am actively looking for a PhD-role to continue my research career. I will graduate in early 2024 and plan to begin my doctorate subsequently. Here is what we can build on:

- my work with [Professor Kristin Shi-Kupfer](https://www.uni-trier.de/en/universitaet/fachbereiche-faecher/fachbereich-ii/faecher/chinese-studies/profile/staff-a-z/translate-to-englisch-prof-dr-kristin-shi-kupfer) on researching narratives among the Chinese diaspora on Twitter
- my Master's thesis on improving Topic/Narrative Modeling exploiting semantic sub-embeddings
- the global explainability method I developed with [David HÃ¼bner](https://david-huebner.com/)
