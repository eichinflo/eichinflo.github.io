Another page of another guy who's trying to make another "awesome" idea work. Chances are, you ended up here because I couldn't resist telling you about it. At the moment, there might not be much to see, but allow me to introduce myself:

This is Florian Eichin, currently in the process of finishing my [Master's in Mathematics in Data Science](https://www.ma.tum.de/en/studies-information/study-programs-mathematics/master-mathematics-in-data-science.html) at [Technical University of Munich](https://www.cit.tum.de/en/cit/home/). Talk to me about your interests and I'll probably get excited, too. Try Natural Language Processing, social computing or chinese tea culture to keep me talking for hours. 

On [Twitter](https://twitter.com/florian_eichin) you can catch me share my thoughts on social and political matters (and be part of my massive follower base). If you're interested in collaborating or just connecting, send me a request on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-eichin/).


What's on the horizon for me?
=====

Well, apart from putting the finishing touches on this website, I'm actively in pursuit of a PhD role to further my research career. Here is a glimpse of what we could build on:

- my work with [Professor Kristin Shi-Kupfer](https://www.uni-trier.de/en/universitaet/fachbereiche-faecher/fachbereich-ii/faecher/chinese-studies/profile/staff-a-z/translate-to-englisch-prof-dr-kristin-shi-kupfer) on researching narratives within the Chinese diaspora on Twitter
- my Master's thesis on improving Topic/Narrative Modeling exploiting semantic sub-embeddings   
- the global explainability method I co-developed with [David HÃ¼bner](https://david-huebner.com/)

Stay tuned as I continue this exciting journey, and feel free to reach out. Let's learn, analyze and discuss together!
